# The `toString()` method

* Analyze `AccountHolder`
* Model a general user of a bank account, identified by an ID.
* The class is implemented by applying the principles of encapsulation and information hiding 
  (which should be applied *always* to *every* class we build from now on).
* Implement the `String toString()` method that is left incomplete.
  (Remember that `String toString()` is the method conventionally used in Java to obtain the textual representation of an object).
