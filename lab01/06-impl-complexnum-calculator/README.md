# Implementing a Calculator for Complex Numbers

1. Implement a Java class `ComplexNumCalculator` that functions as a calculator for complex numbers. It should operate on complex numbers represented by the `ComplexNum` class (copy the previously implemented `ComplexNum` class into this folder to use it during compilation) with the following features:
   * Fields:
     - `int nOpDone` (number of operations performed)
     - `ComplexNum lastRes` (last result)
   * Methods:
     - `void build()` (initialization method)
     - `ComplexNum add(ComplexNum, ComplexNum)` (addition)
     - `ComplexNum sub(ComplexNum, ComplexNum)` (subtraction)
     - `ComplexNum mul(ComplexNum, ComplexNum)` (multiplication)
     - `ComplexNum div(ComplexNum, ComplexNum)` (division)
   
2. Complete the `TestComplexNumCalculator` class according to the comments inside it.

3. Compile and run the program.
